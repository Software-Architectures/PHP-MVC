# Software Architecture Pattern - MVC (Model-View-Controller)

## Description

This repository contains a simple implementation of the MVC pattern.  
The model-view-controller (MVC) pattern divides an application into three components.  
The model contains the application's data and main functionality; the view displays data and interacts with the user;  
and the controller handles user input and acts as the mediator between the model and the view. This pattern enables the application to generate various views, but its layers of abstraction increase complexity.
